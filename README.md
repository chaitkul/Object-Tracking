# Object-Tracking

In the video, a red ball is thrown against a wall. Assuming that the trajectory of the ball follows the equation of a parabola, the objective is to detect and plot the pixel coordinates of the center point of the ball in the video without using inbuilt OpenCV functions, plot its trajectory using matplotlib and determine the landing coordinate of the ball.
